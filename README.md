# my-project
This is for the first time that I am adding my projects to my github repository:my-project
There are two projects here
The first one is based on mtcars descriptive analysis- There is an analysis of the features which affect the miles per gallon of the cars. 
The analysis is done on the basis of the boxplots histogram and density plot. This project was done as part of my data science training at cloudxlab
The  second one is based on bike rentals.
A machine learning algorithm to predict the bike demand .
